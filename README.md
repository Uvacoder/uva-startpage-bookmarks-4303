[Live Version](https://uvastartpage-bookmarks.vercel.app)

Inspired by some of the work on [/r/startpages](https://reddit.com/r/startpages), this is my implementation of a start page.

## Features

- Light / Dark theme support
- Bookmarks stored via browser local storage, no config file needed.
- [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) Support
- Mobile Support
- Search with DuckDuckGo

## Improvements

- Simple icons is a really heavy package. We need to use a CDN to deliver the icons individually
- Offline support isn't perfect, needs more work.
- Sync of some sort
- Search should be expanded to Searchx, Google, Bing, etc. This should be really easy
- Build/Lint system of some sort
